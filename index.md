## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Taks7/RandomMapGeneration/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# Description

In video games a random map is a map generated randomly by the computer, usually in strategy games. Random maps are often the core of single and multiplayer gameplay, aside from story based campaigns that are often shipped with the game.

Each new game presents an unknown map, providing a new experience to the player and random maps typically follow an specific theme, for example, a naval theme with many small islands or a nuclear theme with an open desert with huge bomb holes.
