# Description

In video games a random map is a map generated randomly by the computer, usually in strategy games. Random maps are often the core of single and multiplayer gameplay, aside from story based campaigns that are often shipped with the game.

Each new game presents an unknown map, providing a new experience to the player and random maps typically follow an specific theme, for example, a naval theme with many small islands or a nuclear theme with an open desert with huge bomb holes.

# Why do we want random generated maps?

Nowadays a video game demands several materials to compose a complex and large scene, this is a costly content in the development plan for every game development studio. So these algorithms are made to reduce the amount of work and in the end, time taken to create a game. From the player perspective they can make a huge impact on replayability, because the map you see your first game will not be the same the second time you play.

Maps generated randomly might not be the choice for everyone, it depends on the style and genre of your game to decide if its right or not for your project and there are some major downsides to consider too.
